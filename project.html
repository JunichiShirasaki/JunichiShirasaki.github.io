            </h2>
            <p> 
                Governments and media often compare countries by referring to their rank among OECD members, implicitly treating the OECD as a single, homogeneous group. 
                This project challenges that assumption by examining whether OECD countries are in fact structurally comparable. 
                Using six socio-economic indicators, it explores patterns of similarity and difference across OECD countries and identifies clusters of countries with similar structural profiles. 
                The aim is to show that simple ranking-based comparisons can obscure substantial structural heterogeneity within the OECD and that a cluster-based perspective provides a more informative way to understand cross-country differences.<br>

                Data & Tools 
            </h2>
            
            <p> 
                All data used in this project are sourced from the World Bank’s open API.
                Data collection, cleaning and preparation were fully automated using Python. 
                A single Google Colab notebook handles the entire process, from querying the World Bank API to producing the cleaned and analysis-ready CSV files used in the visualisations.
                This approach ensures full reproducibility: by running the notebook, the entire dataset can be regenerated in one step, allowing the analysis to be easily updated or extended as new data become available.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p> 

                Colab notebook:<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CGvbnFpxLU4rcg5iz8KtN9DD3WlKhBD0?usp=sharing"> here</a> 
                
            </p>

            <p>
                After retrieving raw country-level data from the World Bank API, I harmonised country identifiers and constructed period averages (2015 - 2019) to reduce short-term volatility. 
                The analysis deliberately excludes data from 2020 onwards because the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might introduce unusually large shocks to several indicators, which might make cross-country structural comparison less stable.
                To make indicators comparable, each variable is standardised using z-scores.
                In other words, for each indicator, I subtract the OECD average from a country’s value and then divide the result by the OECD standard deviation. 
                The calculation uses data averaged over the period 2015 - 2019. 
                These standardised indicators formed the basis for making a heatmap and conducting a k-means clustering, which was used to identify broad structural groupings among OECD countries.
                Visualisation is implemented using Vega-Lite. 
                One challenge was ensuring consistent joins between statistical data and a geographic TopoJSON file.
                I addressed this problem by matching ISO numeric codes and validating joins programmatically in Python before visualisation.
                The source of the TopoJSON is as folloes. This file is also collected in the Google Colab notebook above.

            </p>     
            <p> 
                This chart illustrates the distribution of population ageing across OECD countries using a single indicator: <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS">the share of the population aged 65 and over</a> (data source: the Wrodld Bank).
                The purpose of this chart is not to analyse ageing in itself, but to demonstrate that even within the OECD, countries differ substantially along just one commonly used socio-economic dimension. 
                The spread visible in this chart shows that OECD countries are far from uniform, even before considering multiple indicators simultaneously.

            <p> 
                This heatmap provides an overview of socio-economic diversity within the OECD by comparing countries across six key indicators: income level, employment, government size, longevity, industrial structure and population ageing.
                Each indicator is standardised using z-scores.
                Therefore, the values represent deviations from the OECD average rather than absolute levels. 
                This allows structurally different dimensions to be compared on a common scale. 
                Blue cells indicate values above the OECD average, while red cells indicate values below it.
                This chart highlights substantial heterogeneity across OECD countries. 
                No country is consistently above or below average across all dimensions. 
                This visualisation challenges the assumption that OECD membership alone implies comparability.

                 Three patterns in OECD countries: K-means methods</strong>
               </p> 
               <p> 
                This summarises the socio-economic structures of OECD countries using cluster-level profiles. 
                Based on six standardised indicators, countries are grouped into three clusters using k-means clustering. 
                Each line represents the average z-score of a cluster across the six dimensions, whcih shows how each group typically differs from the OECD average.
                Rather than focusing on individual countries, this chart highlights systematic structural patterns. 
                For example, cluster A, which is represented with blue, is characterised by a relatively large government sector and more advanced population ageing, while cluster B, which is represented with orange, combines lower government consumption with stronger manufacturing intensity.
                By presenting cluster averages, this provides an interpretable summary of the main structural types within the OECD.

                This chart shows how OECD structural clusters are distributed across the world map.
                While some clusters include groups of geographically proximate countries, others are spread across multiple regions.
                This indicates that similarities in socio-economic structures cannot be explained by geographic proximity alone.

                 Heterogeneity within Structural Cluster</strong>

            <p> 
                Chart 5 examines heterogeneity within each structural cluster by showing the distribution of country-level z-scores for each indicator. 
                Boxplots summarise the median and interquartile range within clusters, while jittered points represent individual country observations. 
                Although the clusters capture broad structural similarities, the chart shows that substantial variation remains within each group. 
                For several indicators, countries in the same cluster exhibit both above- and below-OECD-average values, indicating that cluster membership does not imply uniform outcomes across dimensions. 
                This highlights a key limitation of cluster-level summaries. They can conceal meaningful internal diversity that is relevant for policy comparison. 
                Overall, Chart 5 reinforces the project’s central argument that understanding cross-country differences requires attention not only to group-level patterns, but also to variation among countries that are often treated as structurally similar..

                Conclusion<br> 
        </h2>
            <p> 
                This project shows that treating OECD countries as a single, homogeneous group can be misleading. 
                By combining standardised indicators with clustering and visualisation, this analysis demonstrates that countries often labelled as “comparable” in rankings occupy very different structural positions. 
                These findings suggest that simple cross-country rankings can obscure important structural differences, which may matter for policy comparison and interpretation. 
                Rather than asking whether a country ranks higher or lower within the OECD, a more informative question is which structural group it belongs to, and how diverse that group itself is.
